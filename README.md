# Nigerian Currency Prediction
This is a deep learning model which predicts the 8 denomination of the Nigerian currency.

# About this project
the Nigerian Currency consists of the 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 naira notes. the model was trained with the front and back pages of these notes, which gave a 20% loss and 82% accuracy for both the training and validation set.

 # Dataset Collection
 As with the "Gender Classification" model in my repo, the different currencies for this project was scraped from google images (see reference to the youtube video used for the web scraping tool in my gender classification repository).
